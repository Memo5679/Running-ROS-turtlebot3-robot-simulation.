# ROS-TurtleBot3-Simulation
I will launch a virtual robot called TurtleBot3. TurtleBot3 is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software.

I lanuch this simulation on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic, Follow the instruction to run the simulation
# install the TurtleBot3 simulator
Open a terminal window and install the dependent packages. Enter the following commands:

    * cd ~/catkin_ws/src/

    * git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git

    * git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git

    * cd ~/catkin_ws and type catkin_make
    
TurtleBot3 has three models, Burger, Waffle, and Waffle Pi, you need to specify which model you want to use, to declare the model 

    * gedit ~/.bashrc
    
Add this line at the bottom of the file:

    * export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger  (save and close)
    
    * source ~/.bashrc
    
# to download the TurtleBot3 simulation files.

    * cd ~/catkin_ws/src/

    * git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git

    * cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
    
# start simulating TurtleBot3 and move the robot using the Keyboard
There are many different environments to simulate the robot in such as empty environment, a house, environment for SLAM testing
i will use the house environment, type:

    * roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch

To move the TurtleBot with your keyboard,open a new terminal and type(make sure it is active while pressing the keys):

    * roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
Control with W A S D X

 # run a simulation file : Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance
 The goal is to have TurtleBot3 autonomously navigate around a room and avoid colliding into objects.
 Open a new terminal and type, to open SLAM environment:
 
    * roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
    
 In another terminal window type:

    * roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch
You should see TurtleBot3 autonomously moving about the world and avoiding obstacles along the way.
